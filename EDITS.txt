added lanes - see example layout for useage
added normalize
added reset for image and ul at top of main.css
--images will now only ever be able to be the max-width of its parent, rather than breaking out.
added a media query for container on mobiles
--will add some padding to the container
removed some old CSS, somethings like text-align only needs to be on the parent
added images folder and put image inside
--this means it doesnt have to rely on it being hosted elsewhere

any questions let me know!
